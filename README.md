# GOST_WebService

Project organization:

  1 - Main dir: it contains the GOST.py library which allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages. The main file is used to make the web server run.
  
  2 - Templates dir: contains the HTML files. Index is of course the homepage, while the other ones' purpose can be guessed easily.
  
  3 - Static dir: it contains favicons and JS scripts, plus some CSS styling.
